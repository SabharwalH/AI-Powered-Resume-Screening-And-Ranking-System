# AI-Powered-Resume-Screening-And-Ranking-System
The AI-Powered Resume Screening and Ranking System is designed to automate and optimize the initial stages of the recruitment process. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this system evaluates and ranks candidates based on their resumes and specific job requirements. 

Key Features
1. Automated Resume Parsing: Extracts key information such as education, work experience, skills, and achievements from PDF resumes using PyPDF2.
2. Job Description Analysis: Converts job descriptions into numerical representations using TfidfVectorizer for accurate comparisons.
3. Candidate Evaluation and Ranking: Uses cosine_similarity to evaluate the relevance of candidates' qualifications and assign ranking scores.
4. User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive web interface for recruiters to upload resumes, input job descriptions, and view ranking results.
5. Continuous Learning: Adapts over time by analyzing historical hiring data and refining its algorithms for improved accuracy.
6. Customization Options: Allows organizations to tailor the system based on their specific preferences, diversity goals, and cultural contexts.

Future Work: 
1. Enhanced Data Preprocessing:
   - Improve the text extraction and preprocessing steps to handle various resume formats and layouts more effectively.
   - Incorporate advanced techniques for handling incomplete or poorly structured resumes, ensuring accurate data extraction.
2. Feature Engineering:
   - Explore additional features that can enhance the model's performance, such as contextual analysis of job descriptions and resumes, and incorporating domain-specific knowledge.
   - Utilize semantic analysis to better understand the relationships between different skills and job requirements.
3. Algorithm Optimization:
   - Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
   - Implement techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize the model's performance.
4. Bias Mitigation:
   - Continuously monitor and address potential biases in the model by incorporating diverse training data and using fairness-aware algorithms.
   - Implement bias detection and mitigation techniques to ensure fair and inclusive candidate evaluations.
